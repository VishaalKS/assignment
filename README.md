- We use JWT (JSON Web Token) for user login authentication.
- The JWT token is stored in a cookie.
- Products are added to the cart using AJAX.
- DataTables are utilized for search functionality.
- Cookies are used to store cart items.
- MySQL is the database used.
- A middleware is implemented to check the presence of the JWT cookie for authentication.
- Form validation is performed using both backend Laravel validation and frontend validation methods.
